Place your glasses1.glb and glasses2.glb 3D model files in this directory.

These files should be WebGL-compatible GLB format files that represent the 3D models of eyeglasses for the virtual try-on feature.

For best results:
1. Models should be properly scaled and centered
2. Models should have realistic materials/textures
3. Origin point should be positioned at the center between the lenses
4. Models should be optimized for web and mobile performance (low poly count)

You can obtain GLDB files from sources like:
- Unity Asset Store
- Sketchfab
- Google Poly
- Your own 3D modeling software (Blender, Maya, etc.)
