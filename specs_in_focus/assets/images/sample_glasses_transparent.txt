# Sample Transparent Glasses Images

This file provides instructions on how to get sample transparent PNG images for testing the virtual try-on feature.

## Quick Start Testing Images

Since we can't directly create PNG files through this interface, here are some options to quickly get transparent glasses PNGs:

1. **Use Online Stock Images**:
   - Visit [StickPNG](https://www.stickpng.com/cat/fashion-accessories/glasses) for free transparent glasses PNGs
   - Visit [PNGItem](https://www.pngitem.com/so/glasses/) for more options

2. **Create Your Own**:
   - Take photos of eyeglasses on a white background
   - Use [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) to automatically remove the background
   - Save as PNG with transparency

3. **Sample Image URLs** (for quick download):

## Naming Convention

After downloading, rename the images to match our naming pattern:
- andy_transparent.png
- astrid_transparent.png
- daria_transparent.png
- eleanor_transparent.png
- enid_transparent.png
- greta_transparent.png
- noah_transparent.png
- oliver_transparent.png

## Placement

Save these files in the `assets/images/` directory alongside the original eyeglasses images.

## Testing

After adding these transparent PNG files, run the app and test the virtual try-on feature. You should see the glasses overlaid on the camera feed with a transparent background.

## For Production

For a production app, we recommend creating your own high-quality transparent PNGs that:
1. Have consistent lighting and scale
2. Are photographed from the same angle (straight-on)
3. Have clean edges with complete transparency
4. Are sized appropriately for mobile display
